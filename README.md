## Summary
This project documents my Home SOC Lab built to practice SOC Analyst (L1) skills such as log analysis, alert investigation, phishing analysis, and basic network traffic analysis using real tools and workflows.

## 🎯Objective
To gain hands-on experience with SOC fundamentals by simulating a small lab environment and practicing detection, investigation, and log analysis from a defender’s perspective.

## 🔭Project Scope
This lab focuses on SOC Analyst (L1) fundamentals and does not include advanced detection engineering or automation.

## 🧪Lab Architecture

**Endpoints**
- Windows 10 VM – Primary endpoint for log analysis
- Ubuntu Linux VM – Linux log and process monitoring
- Kali Linux VM – Traffic generation and analysis support

**Monitoring & Analysis**
- Splunk – Centralized log ingestion and searching
- Windows Event Viewer – Native Windows log analysis
- Wireshark – Network traffic capture and analysis
- Sysmon – for advanced Windows telemetry
 

## ⚒️What I Did in This Lab

- Designed and built a multi-VM SOC lab environment
- Collected and analyzed Windows security event logs
- Investigated authentication and system-related events
- Performed log searching and analysis using Splunk
- Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark
  ## DNS Log Analysis (Splunk)

- Ingested DNS logs in JSON format into Splunk
- Analyzed queried domains and DNS record types
- Identified frequently accessed domains and internal queries
- Practiced SOC-style investigation using search and aggregation



## Skills Practiced
- Log Analysis & Alert Investigation  
- Windows and Linux Fundamentals for SOC  
- Basic Network Traffic Analysis  
- Incident Investigation Workflow
